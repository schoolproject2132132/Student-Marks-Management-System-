# Student Marks Management System - Pro Edition

## Overview

The **Student Marks Management System - Pro Edition** is a next-generation, production-grade Python application that allows you to manage student academic records, visualise their marks, and store everything securely in a MySQL database. It features a modern, modular design with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced data visualisation, and a user-friendly, interactive command-line interface.

This project surpasses basic AI-generated templates by providing:

* Deep modular structure
* Full MySQL integration
* Data validation & error handling
* High-quality Matplotlib and Plotly visual reports
* Text-based reports saved locally
* Future-proof, clean codebase ready for expansion

‚úÖ Modern, human-friendly CLI experience with colour outputs
‚úÖ Student details and marks stored in MySQL (localhost)
‚úÖ Auto creation of required database tables
‚úÖ Subject-wise marks entry with percentage and grade calculation
‚úÖ Generates:

* Text-based student report file
* Pie Chart of marks distribution (PNG)
* Bar Graph of marks per subject (PNG)
* Interactive Plotly chart (HTML)
  ‚úÖ Secure parameterised SQL queries
  ‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/Mac)
  ‚úÖ Modular, maintainable code exceeding 250+ lines
  ‚úÖ Extensible architecture for future features

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

### Python Libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib plotly pandas numpy mysql-connector-python colorama
```

### MySQL Server:

Ensure MySQL is installed and running on `localhost` (port 3306).

### MySQL Setup:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_marks;
```

Update the database connection credentials in `DatabaseManager` Class if you have a different user or password:

```python
self.conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='',  # Update this if you set a password
    database='student_marks'
)
```

## How to Run the Application

1. Make sure your MySQL server is running.
2. Run the main program:

```bash
python student_marks_system.py
```

3. Follow the friendly prompts to:

   * Enter student details
   * Enter subject names and marks
   * View the calculated percentage and grade
   * Generate and view graphical reports
4. All data is stored securely in your MySQL database.
5. Text reports and visual charts are saved locally.

## Sample Usage Example

```plaintext
üëã Welcome to Student Marks Manager (Pro Edition)

1Ô∏è‚É£  Enter Student Details & Report
2Ô∏è‚É£  Exit

Select an option (1 or 2): 1

üöÄ Let's Gather Student Information
Full Name: Alice Johnson
Class: 12A
Roll Number: 45

üìö Subject & Marks Entry (Type 'done' to finish)
Subject Name: Mathematics
Marks in Mathematics (out of 100): 95
Subject Name: Science
Marks in Science (out of 100): 88
Subject Name: done

üìÑ Report for Alice Johnson
Subject           Marks
-----------------------
Mathematics       95.00
Science           88.00
-----------------------
Percentage:       91.50%
Grade:            A+ üåü
```

## Technical Details

* Uses **Matplotlib** for static Pie and Bar charts
* Uses **Plotly** for interactive HTML graphs
* Secure SQL inserts prevent injection attacks
* Supports unlimited subjects per student
* Designed with **separation of concerns**:

  * `DatabaseManager`: Handles all database operations
  * `Student`: Manages student data and calculations
  * `Visualizer`: Handles charts and reporting
  * `StudentMarksApp`: Orchestrates the workflow
* Follows clean coding standards with type hints and docstrings

---

## Troubleshooting

‚ùó **MySQL Connection Error**:

* Ensure MySQL server is running:

```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

* Verify credentials inside `DatabaseManager`

‚ùó **ModuleNotFoundError**:

* Run:

```bash
pip install matplotlib plotly pandas numpy mysql-connector-python colorama
```

‚ùó **Unicode Errors on Windows**:

* Run terminal with UTF-8 support or adjust console settings.

---

## Future Improvements (Planned)

* Export reports to PDF/Excel
* Multi-student batch processing
* Login system with user roles (Admin/Student)
* Search, edit, and delete student records
* Performance analytics across terms
* More advanced error handling & unit tests
